    <p>
        This is the Enchanted Mushroom that houses the very rare garden pixies of Dobell Manor. The garden pixies are rarely seen due to their size and scarce numbers. Garden pixies measure about 1cm tall and it is said there are only a few dozen left in the world. They are protected in this magical mushroom and cannot be harmed once inside. 
    </p>
        
    <p>
        This enchanted mushroom has magical protective powers where it never dies and can never be destroyed. If the mushroom senses a harmful presence it can also become invisible to further protect the pixies. The mushroom may choose to spread into more mushrooms if needed where all mushrooms would be connected sharing its power.
    </p>

    <p>
        The main enchanted mushroom must remain stationary or it loses its eternal power. As the human population increases, garden pixies fear the new world as resources become farther and farther away and travelling has become more dangerous.

    <p>
        This is Autumn Cotton which provides a soft material spun into clothing for the garden pixies. It only appears once a year in the autumn season so the pixies must stock up in order to stay warm throughout the winter months and to provide clothing for any new offspring. The garden pixies tend to create clothing much like how we humans knit or crochet.
